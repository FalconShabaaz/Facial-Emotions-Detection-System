# Facial-Emotions-Detection-System
This project is an implementation of a real-time facial emotions detection system, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. The system uses a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of facial expressions to recognize the emotions expressed by a person in front of a camera.
